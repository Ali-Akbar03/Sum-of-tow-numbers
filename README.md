Explanation:
Scanner Object: The program uses Scanner to get input from the user. Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); creates an object called scanner to read user input from the keyboard.

 It then reads the numbers entered by the user using scanner.nextInt() and stores them in variables num1 and num2.    
Sum Calculation:The sum of the two numbers is calculated using int sum = num1 + num2;.
Display the Result:The result (sum) is printed to the screen with System.out.println().
Close Scanner:Finally, scanner.close() closes the scanner to free up resources.
